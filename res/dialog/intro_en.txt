In every city, tiny worlds exist unseen by you and I. 
In every backstreet, in every trashcan, in every mouldy cardboard box.: Tiny worlds occupied by the tiniest beings.
It's time for you to meet Pip. He's a flea, one of the tiniest of the tiny beings.
He's the star of the local flea circus. The problem is, he wishes he wasn't.
One day, Pip decided to escape the circus.: To escape his tiny world, and to enter our own.
Let's help him escape!
